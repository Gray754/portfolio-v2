        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up I've always tried to find new ways to express myself
          creatively. As a child, I'd spend all night building new things with
          the thousands of LEGOs I had. Eventually my parents bought their first
          computer, and I instantly fell in love with it after seeing the
          Windows '98 splash screen. After spending years studying computer
          hardware and networking, I eventually fell into web development and
          have been in love ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web Development isn't just a job to me. It's so much more. It's my
          creative outlet. My hobby. My lifestyle. I'm very passionate about the
          work that I do. When I'm not on my computer coding, you can probably
          find me either obsessing over anything and everything Batman, spending
          time with my beautiful fianc√©, or hunting for Pokemon in my local
          park.
